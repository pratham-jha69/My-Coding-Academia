        She think she the main because I keep her by my side
        Double-O, bust down the watch, she know that I'm timeless (timeless)
        I put my son in some Rick
        I pull that gun off the hip
        Pockets hold twenty-two clips (ah)
        I break her heart, Comme Gar√ßons
        Put on a shirt, get put on a blimp
        Bitch like a stain, get ready to lick
        I had to tell her that ever since I was a jit, knew I was the shit(oh)

        House like a bank, deposit this bitch, deposit that check
        Smile on my face, ain't playing shit, come and get checked (uh)
        Ice on my neck, Double-O wrist
        She in the Scat, hell of a 'Cat
        Fresh out the trench, four hundred packs
        Uh, yeah, I'm spinnin' in Paris (uh)
        Dress for these hoes, they finna flock
        Just poured a four in a soda, it pop
        Them drugs finna hit, I'm feelin' ill
        I'm wrestlin' all of my demons, I feel like The Rock

        Ever since I was a kid, I been legit (jit, ooh, nah)
        If I was you, I would cut up my wrist (dumb bit')

        Fill up the sky (yeah), I fill up the Dome
        They'll play it one day (yeah), it's a hell of a show
        But it's gonna hurt 'cause we did it first
        Feel like Skateboard P, BBC boys on the creep
        Feel like it's '03, Neptune drum with a beam (yeah)
        She hippie-flippin' a bean, she wanna fuck with the team
        She fell in love with the cream (yeah), she fell in love with the scene
        Ooh, yeah, her man quiet, not a peep (oh, nah)
        Broke his heart, PTSD (oh, nah)
        Hold his chest, let it breathe
        Let it breathe, niggas scheme
        And I got a priest, he got a cross
        Get out of line, send him to God
        I shed a tear, pray for a loss, ooh, yeah (yeah)

        Ever since I was a kid, I been legit (Homixide, Homixide, Homixide, oh, oh)
        If I was you, I would cut up my wrist (ah)
