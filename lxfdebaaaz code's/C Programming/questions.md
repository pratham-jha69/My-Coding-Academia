**1. If-Else Statements**
Easy:
Question: Write a program that checks if a number entered by the user is positive, negative, or zero using if-else statements.
Medium:
Question: Write a program that takes three numbers as input and finds the largest one using nested if-else statements.
Hard:
Question: Implement a grading system where the user inputs a student's score, and the program outputs a grade (A, B, C, D, F) using if-else statements. The program should handle incorrect inputs (e.g., numbers greater than 100 or less than 0).
**2. Switch Case Control**
Easy:
Question: Write a program that takes a number (1-12) from the user and prints the corresponding month using a switch case statement.
Medium:
Question: Develop a calculator that can perform basic operations (+, -, *, /, %) using a switch case. The user enters two numbers and an operator, and the program outputs the result.
Hard:
Question: Write a program using switch case that simulates a simple menu-based system. The menu should allow the user to select options like "Open File," "Save File," "Exit," and "Invalid Option" using a switch case. Handle incorrect inputs and re-display the menu until the user chooses "Exit."
**3. Do-While Loop**
Easy:
Question: Write a program using a do-while loop that prompts the user to input a number and continues to ask until the user enters a positive number.
Medium:
Question: Write a program using a do-while loop that calculates and prints the factorial of a number entered by the user.
Hard:
Question: Write a program that uses a do-while loop to display a menu for a bank system. The user can choose to deposit, withdraw, check balance, or exit. The program should loop until the user selects exit.
**4. While Loop**
Easy:
Question: Write a program that prints the first 10 natural numbers using a while loop.
Medium:
Question: Write a program that uses a while loop to reverse the digits of a number entered by the user (e.g., input: 12345, output: 54321).
Hard:
Question: Write a program that checks whether a number is prime or not using a while loop.
**5. For Loop**
Easy:
Question: Write a program that prints the multiplication table of a number using a for loop.
Medium:
Question: Write a program using a for loop to find the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 100.
Hard:
Question: Write a program that prints the Fibonacci sequence up to a number 'n' entered by the user using a for loop.
**6. Break and Continue**
Easy:
Question: Write a program using a for loop that prints numbers from 1 to 10 but skips printing the number 5 using the continue statement.
Medium:
Question: Write a program that takes a list of numbers from the user and stops the input when the user enters a negative number using the break statement.
Hard:
Question: Write a program that simulates a simple password system. The user has three attempts to input the correct password using break and continue. If the user enters the wrong password, they are prompted to try again.
**7. Goto Statements**
Easy:
Question: Write a simple program using the goto statement to jump to a label if a number entered by the user is negative, otherwise continue normally.
Medium:
Question: Implement a program where, using the goto statement, the user is repeatedly asked for a valid integer input. If the input is invalid (non-integer), the program jumps back and asks again.
Hard:
Question: Write a C program to simulate a basic game where the user must guess a number between 1 and 10. If the user enters an invalid number (outside the range), use the goto statement to send them back to the beginning.
**8. Typecasting**
Easy:
Question: Write a program that takes a floating-point number and typecasts it to an integer. Display both the original and the typecasted values.
Medium:
Question: Create a program that calculates the average of three integers entered by the user, but typecast the result to a floating-point number to display a more precise result.
Hard:
Question: Write a program that calculates the sum of the ASCII values of characters entered by the user (up to 5 characters). Typecast the characters to integers and display the total sum.
